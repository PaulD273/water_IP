     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     8769 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts

     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE0
                           (   6   4   8   4   0   0   0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.25
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     gamma-point specific algorithms are used

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
